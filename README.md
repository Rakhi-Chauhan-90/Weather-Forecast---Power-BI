##  🌦️ Power BI Weather Forecast Dashboard
Project Overview
This project is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that provides detailed weather forecasts and key meteorological insights for cities in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Western Uttar Pradesh. The goal of this project was to demonstrate my skills in data analytics, data modeling, and data visualization by transforming raw weather data into a user-friendly and actionable report.

The dashboard focuses on real-world data from cities including Amroha, Gajraula, Ghaziabad, Noida, and Moradabad.

## 📊 Key Features & Visualizations
The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of current and future weather conditions through a series of intuitive visuals and KPIs.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Wind Speed: 🌬️ Track wind velocity.

Pressure: 💨 Monitor atmospheric pressure.

Humidity: 💧 View moisture levels in the air.

Visibility: 🔎 Assess visibility conditions.

UV Index: ☀️ A measure of the sun's UV radiation level.

Precipitation: 🌧️ Forecast the amount of rainfall.

## Interactive Visuals:

Forecast Weather: A visual timeline of the weather for the coming days.

Sunrise & Sunset: Visualize the daily cycle of daylight.

Chance of Rain: A clear chart showing the probability of precipitation.

Air Quality Index (AQI): Monitor local air quality levels for health awareness.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
Power BI Desktop: The primary tool used for building the dashboard, including data modeling and visualization.

Power Query: Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). This includes connecting to the data source, cleaning the data, and shaping it for analysis.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for creating custom measures and calculated columns to derive insights and build the KPIs.
